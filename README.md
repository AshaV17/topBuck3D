topBuck3D- Buckling based 3D Topology Optimization

A MATLAB code for three-dimensional topology optimization, based on buckling objective/constraint, is developed inspired by a two-dimensional code topBuck250.m by Ferrari et. al. 
Applied in this work on Lattice Structures of SC and BCC.
The function call is 
topBuck3D(nelx,nely,nelz,penalK,rmin,ft,ftBC,eta,beta,maxit,ocPar,Lx,Ly,penalG,nEig,pA gg,prSel,fil)
